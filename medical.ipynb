She might We can face time with it like yesterday. Yeah Oh, no, I'm sorry to right when here we go You hear me Hello Gee, you hear me You hear me It's sorry, it's something wrong with the Wi-Fi You made it back to my phone? Let me just try one more time I'll turn on Wi-Fi on How do you mind taking this one to their cold? Oh, it's right here I don't see Can you hear me now? You can hear me, but I can't hear you Okay This is my auntie. She's on the phone my mom. I'm not sure where she's up. She um, I don't know I think it's the wrong my phone No, it's okay This is the dear that didn't you right? Yep, this is the doctor. I forgot your name. Sorry My last name So my chest it feels like like bricks are on it. I can't breathe like when I'm talking I'm gasping for air And then I pressed the button, but it's not doing anything. I don't know, but I think the Decontaneous rate needs to go up so that I don't have to press it as much But I'm not exactly sure so I wanted to get you a Piano 9 I was thinking maybe Is it possible we could do another X-ray? So that we can see if the moon the moon is getting worse or is it getting better? So let me what other questions do you have? I want to know more for me should let this cluster care and the results on the corona and Just an overall update of what's what are we gonna do for me here? Sounds good. Great questions. So I'll start with the first question about the pain medicine Okay In order for me to better answer your question. Yeah, I was wondering when you When you give yourself a push What does your pain level go from recently and hasn't been dropping at all It's just been stainless when When you say recently is that like the last hour or is that like no? Probably since last night, okay, and Were you able to get sleep last night? For a little while, but as soon as I woke up I was in pain like just my back is just like aching like I've been held down and not breathing Yeah, and then I just I got in a shower because I have just the max and I could get out the bed fast and I Had to get a mug. I pressed it first and I didn't like do anything. I had to Kind of push through a lot of pain so that I can be clean really Yeah, okay, and I guess before the change last night What was your when I saw you yesterday morning your pain levels like an eight? Did it get any better with the change and the dose increased during the course of the day? Because we could go up on the ball of stokes yesterday So I thought it was the same it you just went up on The amount of time in between each so that we actually gave you more per dose When you pushed it so I feel the drowsiness, but I don't think I'm necessarily feeling that And I think I'm necessarily feeling the relief. Okay, I see So I guess another way what I'm Summarizing what users said is that your pain level didn't get that much better over the course of yesterday But you did feel more beside effects of drowsiness. Yeah So I think that we can increase the the basil rate in the background Right the one that pushes push dose the same for now and see how that goes. Is that's not okay? Yeah, so that's the one that every hour right getting in the background. Okay. Yep The in order to answer your Second question about the chest heaviness and whether or not a chest x-ray would be helpful at this point I don't think a chest x-ray is going to be helpful at this point the reason I say that is because I am very reassured by your oxygen saturation and your oxygen needs so So what is what are the Situations your oxygen saturation is looked really great. I mean here in the room with you Your oxygen saturation has been anywhere from 96% to a hundred percent So I think that only reason is because I have the oxygen on it right when I take it off It's like So hard right to breathe even now it's still hard your Your oxygen needs so this is the second part of the reason why I'm reassured are very low So you are on one liter per minute of oxygen and Just to give you a sense of what that is is in the grand scheme of oxygen needs It's very small. It's like the lowest amount that we can actually give supplemental and Supplementary oxygen on top of just what we breathe in the normal air I hear you I hear you but but I guess my point is that a chest x-ray at this point isn't gonna change our management Well, I didn't want to change. I want to be reassured of The pneumonia inside of it's building her So the interesting thing about chest x-rays You're learning a lot about medicine talking to me. I hope that's okay. No, I'm sorry I want to be nice. So chest x-rays are helpful when I just My braces are cutting and That's I need the cause to put in the my lips You need more Yes, please The interesting thing about chest x-rays That's a great are really helpful when there's new findings like a new pneumonia but we know from Our experience in terms of like Getting chest x-rays on lots of people people who have pneumonia is that there can be what's called residual Can I get more goss please Channetay go God Okay, so what I was saying is that after the initial chest x-ray that shows in pneumonia You can see evidence of that Change on the chest x-ray sometimes for four to six weeks even after the pneumonia symptoms go away So it's getting worse than unexplained why can't breathe so we are Any hospital guys they always continue to do x-rays to see the progress of it So I'm a little bit confused as to why we don't want to do it now So like for the reasons that I said if you were to require more oxygen Right your oxygen needs have been stable Honestly, I do require My chest it's like bricks are right here and here and it's just waiting down on me when my oxygen slipped off last night It was all the way it was very very low like it was beeping red Yeah, and I was gasping for yeah, so I hear what you're saying about it What I'm telling you is that based upon your oxygen saturation you see that blue number right there? It's a hundred yes perfect Correct, but her oxygen needs have not gone up meaning that she has not needed more oxygen today than yesterday Okay, so I'm not understanding this is what where it's Confused to me in this piece in the off because obviously something is going wrong as to why her chest is doing heavier and heavy It's not adding up. Obviously whatever is going on or whatever y'all giving her is not working That's why I'm saying maybe she do need another test x-rays to see if they got it worse or if it got him better Because if it got him worse, maybe y'all can go back in It's a different type of antibiotic clicking give us that a given this and maybe see if that will Start helping the process of the one away or way because I don't understand Who around as to why she said her So heavy and heavy her test is not gonna feel heavy and heavier if if she's getting better I hear what you're saying and sometimes the The problem can be in terms of the chest feeling heavy is that our pain control is not good enough for the acute chest syndrome So what it so if I was to try To go without the oxygen I'm not recommending that okay, so then that's what I don't understand if the pain is like if we get to pain under control I still don't feel any change in my chest So what do you suggest how do we figure this out on whether do I need a different antibiotic or not? Where is it just getting worse because you can't figure it out by just looking at me you have to go into it And that's why I suggest that the x-ray because you don't think that's a good idea Okay Excuse me that's why don't you feel like that x-ray is a good idea? Because he's saying the prop you're gonna be able to see that for it. You said weeks rate. Yeah, you're still gonna be able to see it But we also I hear that for a right you're not gonna be able to see nothing for weeks But we've been doing with this all her life So we know how the process goes And and all her three years times as she was hospitalized and had a cue they did x-rays to see like if it's getting better Or if it's getting worse so that's why I'm not understanding that's why you said okay Yeah, well, you don't feel like it's gonna be a change because you don't use the changes for a couple weeks But in the past and I'm talking about the most easy And she had it to you We the difference in the x-ray So I'm not saying that's why are you saying that you don't feel like you want to see anything? I don't understand what's the problem with a patient Why you just want to just go ahead be like okay, no way fine I'm gonna give you another x-ray if this x-ray feel is the same then we can go through there Okay, so the read so I'll be honest with you When I'm when I'm dealing with a patient who's I don't know why The team did last time when she was hospitalized get an x-ray every day He's gonna explain So you're so as an 18 year old girl Any any radiation that we give you is gonna build up over to the course of your lifetime I know and what what I'm telling you is from my clinical experience I don't think you need an x-ray right to second That's all I'm saying What would you suggest that we go to what I was suggesting what I would suggest is trying to If you're saying I'm not just letting him talk So in my I'm not I'm not frustrated. I just wanted to explain the plan what I would like to say Expectations about what the plan would be okay? Let's try to go up on the pain control see if that makes you feel better in the chest too Okay, if it doesn't we're gonna chest x-ray. How does that sound? Okay? Today I want to see This afternoon, so I want just a couple of hours with the pain Control difference by 3 p.m. Today if there's no difference you're still feeling the heaviness We'll get a chest x-ray. Okay, if the pain starts getting better It really starts feeling a little bit easier with the difference in the pain control Then we'll wait and mostly how it goes What I do believe the pain is connected to the chest but it's also Being furthered by the pneumonia And so that's whether I just can't but I I can see what you're talking about We'll see if they have any difference. Yeah, we'll do that Okay, yes Hmm I can't hear you before I'm looking at you Yeah, he's here. He said that if we go up on the pain The continuous ray I suggested that because I'm still in pain no matter if I push the button or not I know I know it's hitting me to sleep but There's no connection I can't hear you I'm moving the phone so I can so it gets connection Oh It's 12 now three hours is really not Waiting that long okay Like can we once I get more connection I can continue this part discussion after so about the rest of my questions So in terms of the coronavirus testing the machine that Was running the test on malfunction last night And so we are they're working ever since last night when they started malfunctioning They've been working on trying to get it working again It's very convenient that right when I want to get tested It's Yeah, I'm sorry, you know all all of our patients are really trust me because I've been truly different Every since I got that testing and I'm positive I don't have it But I've been being treated different because because the machine my It's just really frustrating yeah, I hear you And just so you know you're you're also in the same boat as the other patients who are being rolled out And unfortunately there's nothing that I can do about that machine We we've contacted them obviously today about all of our patients to try to expedite the testing here Why wasn't I took this one? If we just found out this morning Correct, but I don't I don't think that the Team was aware about it here until this morning because their test isn't run overnight Is it possible to be No, this is the only lab that's running this time right now if it's gonna be delayed longer than we will Our team here will be talking to which other lab can run it Okay, so I'm still gonna be an isolation technically Correct just because of the malfunction correct Sorry, it's hard being 18 And isolation is treated totally different I understand We're out No, I can't hear you Stop moving the phone here. I'm gonna call you right back look Yeah Yeah, I'm trying to call you right really so basically the machine the machine for the crew Yeah, she's getting antibiotics once a day same antibiotic she was getting yesterday I don't get it And um the plan that I made with her just so you I don't know if you could hear us with that we're gonna go up on the Background rate of the pain control now if there's no improvement in her chest pain symptoms or tightness By three p.m. Today, so it's three hours. It's not we're not waiting Days we're just waiting three hours. There's no change at all. We'll get another extra Okay, I just want to see if the pain control change could make a difference See in the already thing I hear you because that sounds like a good plan especially she's in green to it's fine But the only thing is that the medicine now the dough whatever no shot given if she said it's not working But then I told the side effects are not good why she's having headache She All So that's why I'm like are you going up on the pain medicine that good idea or should you switch the pain? Because the side effects you have it's not good So the other option Do you think they can take it out give a switch and and Switch and maybe keep the dose that we have now see does that make a difference because I don't want to do more jobs And like I feel if I was like No, we shouldn't be like having like And I don't know like an active imagination like we should drink or something I mean, you know we certainly can try an oral pill on top of the Medicine you're getting now Like oxycodone that's not a problem if you want to try that what I'd be able to do oxycodone and the PCA and then Was this morphine as the world? Every like like a pretty spread out so that it's not sort of The side effects aren't all built up on you Yeah Yeah, so you're wondering if I could do oral morphine instead of oxycodone? Yeah oral morphine instead of oxycodone In the PCA you can't so oxycodone is a pill it doesn't come in this form No, so I've had a good boy There's no there's no intravenous form of oxycodone Okay, so the only intravenous medicines that are opiates are morphine Delotted and something called fentanyl but fentanyl was something that we only give any I see it right we didn't want to try to So should we just do oxycodone orally on a on a time schedule and maybe keep this the same for For now and if that doesn't work Well, I can't get off the market. I have to keep them both But are you going to be all oxycodone more feed and PCA? Is that what you saying? So I'm trying to work with you guys so if you want to try the oral version of morphine On top of the IV version we can try that that's one option Or we can try the oxycodone on top of the PCA of morphine and leave this the same I would not do oral morphine and oral oxycodone and the PCA I would not be So which one do you suggest? I mean it sounds like you've had good response to oxycodone in the past So I would recommend trying that So the oxycodone orally by itself with this in the background And no button Still you can still use the button. Okay. Yeah, we could try that. Okay Like pushing it out. That's the mechanism So we'll leave this the same the PCA not gonna change the background today We'll give you a dose of the oxycodone That typically lasts about three or four hours. So it'll be every four hours. I'm taking a dose of yeah oxycodone correct You can try yeah Okay, so if okay, so if y'all know what this plan Right now that we're talking about Are you still\n",

      "**Explanation:** Pain medicine refers to medications that are used to relieve pain.  Different types are available for different types of pain.

      "**Explanation:** Chest heaviness is a feeling of pressure or discomfort in the chest. It can range from a mild, fleeting feeling to a severe, ongoing problem.  It's important to note that chest heaviness can have many causes, some of which are serious.  It's vital to get it checked by a doctor.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Term:** Chest x-ray\n",
      "\n",
      "**Explanation:** A chest x-ray is a simple medical test that takes pictures of the inside of your chest, specifically your lungs, heart, and bones.  It can help doctors see if there are any problems, such as infections, injuries, or tumors.  The x-ray helps determine if something is worsening or improving. It doesn't show every issue, but it's a helpful first step.\n",

      "**Term:** (Implied) Possible causes of chest pain and heaviness\n",
      "\n",
      "**Explanation:** Many things can cause chest pain and heaviness, ranging from relatively minor (like heartburn or muscle strain) to serious (like a heart attack or lung issues).  Symptoms and cause are interconnected and are why the doctor needed to talk to patients.  Only a doctor can diagnose the cause.  Possible underlying issues that could lead to these symptoms include:\n",
      "* **Heart problems:**  Chest pain can be a symptom of a heart attack or angina (chest pain due to reduced blood flow to the heart).\n",
      "* **Lung problems:**  Infections, pneumonia, or other lung conditions can cause chest pain or tightness.\n",
      "* **Digestive issues:**  Heartburn or acid reflux can feel like chest pain.\n",
      "* **Muscle or rib injuries:**  Sore muscles or injuries to the ribs can also cause pain.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Important Note:** This information is for general knowledge and understanding.  It is *absolutely crucial* to consult a doctor if you experience chest pain or heaviness.  A doctor can properly diagnose the cause and recommend the most appropriate treatment.\n",
